V3.10.6:
  - Improving subset creation
  - PLUGIN_MODULE variable can be used in host.conf to customize mpirun command: mpirun.PLUGIN_MODULE --> mpirun.relion)
       This approach implies having this pattern for all mpi plugins that use mpi.
  - Alternatively, in the scipion.conf file a variable called PARALLEL_COMMAND_XXX could be defined for a more
       versatile way to have a mpi command only for some plugins. Example:
       PARALLEL_COMMAND_RELION=mpirun.relion -np %%(JOB_NODES)d --map-by node %%(COMMAND)s
       NOTE: in this config file, %_ (valid and needed in host.conf) should be replaced by %%
  - GPU Ids are automatically anonymized (0-len(GPUs)) when using queues
  - Bug-fix: creation time is not loaded when loadig run.db (updating a protocol)
  developers:
  - Adding a Streaming section in ProtStreamingBase
  - runJob call without %(GPU)s will not reserve GPU slots anymore.
   
V3.10.5: cancel usage of SCIPION_PROJECT in the host template
V3.10.4: hotfix: Parallelization with GPUs is fixed and step queue executor fixed with the new implementation.
V3.10.3: Failed hotfix

V3.10.1: hotfix: Avoid double Gpu assignment in scipion parallelize protocols with concurrent GPU steps
V3.10.0
developers:
  - stepsExecutionMode = STEPS_SERIAL at class level. Should be a class attribute for future versions. Now both approaches are valid.

V3.9.2 - hotfix: rescue commented methods: Protocol._insertRunJobStep and Protocol._insertCopyFileStep
V3.9.1 - hotfix: loading related objects (CTF - Mics in particle extraction)
V3.9.0
  - Project can have a comment (tooltip over the project name and click will edit it). Will be populated with templates description.
  - Project Color modes:
       size color mode removed: Problematic in slow setups or huge projects.
       labels color mode merged with status color mode.
  - Manual subsets works when SCIPION_USE_QUEUE is active. For now this execution is not sent to the QUEUE: Might need to ask for the queue parameters.
  - Step details show it step needs a GPU
  - Folder size not showing in protocol's tooltip: poor performance in some setups
  - Threads field and help improved: Distinguish between "Scipion threads" and "Threads" (program threads)
  - create script accepts a comment (location optional as -)

    Protocol._lock context, which causes a permanent lock.
  - XmlMapper removed.
  - FlatMapper instanatiation centralized:
     New variable: SCIPION_MAPPER_USE_TEMPLATE. By default uses the template as it was now. If deacivated, instantiation happens on each iteration (less performant) but dev friendly

  - Object.clone a copy optionally clones the enable flag
  - Set.getItem: returns the first item with a value in the fields passed. Useful for querying by TsId in tomo.
