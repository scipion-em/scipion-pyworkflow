 - scipion printenv returns also int variables.
 - Tolerate project update errors (e.g.: read only filesystem due to quota + update)
 - Check if scheduled process is alive when updating.

Developers:
 - Some modules switched to use logger instead of print: viewprotocols.py, browser.py and launch.py,
   pw_schedule_run.py, viewprojects.py, canvas.py, project.py, protocol.py.
 - LoggerConfigurator adapted to received logfile, flag for console handler and line format.
 - pw_run_tests.py uses logging now.

V3.0.22
-------
 - Fixing a persistent error related with the logic of the EXECUTE/SCHEDULE button


V3.0.21
-------
 - Generating an interface to create the scipion log file.
 - Creating an option to display the scipion log
 - New "Search protocol in graph" (Control + l) window to locate a box in the graph
 - At loading time, selected protocol is "focused" (window scrolls to it)
 - Control + MouseWheel scrolls horizontally
 - Links are also detected when they are just "http"
 - Bugfixed: Input list is shown when there are possible outputs and need to "expose details" (like selecting a specific volume in a set)
 - Bugfixed: Outputs that a numeric do not break the "Browse object window"
 - Fixing an error related with the logic of the EXECUTE/SCHEDULE button

Developers:
 - prerequisites could be just the id or the previous list of ids when adding a step.

V3.0.20
-------
 - Empty sections/subsection (without protocols) in the left tree will not be shown

Developers:
 - Allow pointers to be defined with a list of classes instead of a string: "SetOfParticles, SetOfAverages" or [ SetOfParticles, SetOfAverages ]
 - Two "utils" functions: hasAnyFileChanged, hasFileChangedSince to check if a file/s have changed since a "time" passed.
 - BaseTest now has: setupTestOutput exposed --> self.setupTestOutput()
 - Allow getting an item in a set not only by id but by a query: myset["_tsId=tomo1"].


V3.0.19
-------

 - Fix: outputs after a Scalar output (boxSize from pickings) weren't offered to the chosen
 - Defining a new format to handler the log

V3.0.18
-------
 - Fixed GUI errors:
   - fixing the workflow collapse/expand nodes
   - resetting nodes with manual subset looses the parent
   - reporting the protocol wall time
   - finished protocol can't be modified
 - Fixed: execute a protocol directly that is not streaming and that has an open input must be scheduled
 - Close all sets when stopping a protocol
 - fixing an error closing some viewers(the action of closing some viewers closes Scipion completely)
 - fixing an error drawing the protocols step tree
 - fixing an error deleting a protocol by the keyboard
 - logging DEBUG mode will be activated when toggling debug mode
 - A dramatic plugin import error will be tolerated. Plugin will not be loaded.
 - Possible outputs definition is now possible. Protocols can define possible outputs to allow designing
   a workflow in advance without executing them.
 - New variable added: SCIPION_STEPS_CHECK_SEC. Defaults to 3 (seconds). It represents how often new input is checked in streamified protocols. Increasing this   
   value will relax the stress in the system, but will feel less "alive".
 - Workflow templates can now be imported into an existing project

Developers:
 - Possible Outputs allowed: dict or enum definition possible, see Protocol._possibleOutput
 - Allow readonly parameters in protocols. Useful in combination with wizards or just informative parameters.
 - Added the variable SCIPION_PRIORITY_PACKAGE_LIST that is used in the view
   protocols in order to load first the plugins that contains the main
   protocols.conf sections. This variable is defined as string with the packages names separated by a space.
   e.g: SCIPION_PRIORITY_PACKAGE_LIST = "pwem tomo cistem"

-------
 - Second tab of logs have just error messages (stderr output)
 - Tests show stderr output too (last lines)
 - Report host.conf submit command problems when parsing/formatting fails
